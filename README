What is this
------------

This is a repository that contains my resume.

Building
--------

The resume is optimized to be built into a PDF using xelatex.

In order to achieve this, you need:

   * A LaTeX distribution (TeXLive 2011 recommended);
   * XeLaTeX;
   * CTeX;
   * MinionPro and MyriadPro fonts (you can find them with Acrobat Reader).

You can alse build it in Windows and Linux.
